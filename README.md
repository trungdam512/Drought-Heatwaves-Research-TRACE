# Drought-Heatwaves-Research-TRACE

Summer 2023 research on climate stressors, including heatwaves, low rainfall patterns, and their effects on plant biodiversity in El Yunque, Luquillo, Puerto Rico with Dr. Christine Sierra O'Connell and Tropical Responses to Altered Climate Experiment (TRACE).

## Description

The dynamic of precipitation and temperature in tropical rainforests has always been an ongoing research topic. This research aims to delve into the interconnection of daily rainfall and occasionally heat shock in two study sites in Puerto Rico: Sabana Field Research Station and Bisley Experimental Watersheds. Sabana Field Research Station is at the elevation of 100 meters above sea level, whereas Bisley is located 265-456 meters above sea level. These two sites are chosen to investigate the discrepancy of the relationship between rainfall and temperature across different topography. This research further explores the impact of low rainfall and heat shock periods on Sabana Field Research Stationâ€™s biodiversity. Meteorological and ecological censuses data was analyzed and fit into linear/logistic models to provide insights for this research.

## Results

  - Different topography contributes to different climatic conditions: Bisley Watersheds had more amount of rainfall and lower range of daily average temperature over the course of 2014-2015
  - There is an association between low rainfall events and high heat shock in both study sites: Sabana Field Research Station and Bisley Experimental Watersheds
  - Sabana Field Research Station are suggested to experience lower precipitation and higher temperature than Bisley Watersheds
  - After the major drought in 2015, as the occurences of climate stressors (low rainfall events and high heat shock), the Shannon's biodiversity of Sabana Research Center gradually decreased, implying the decline of several plant types
  - PREMON, PIPHIS, and ROYBOR are found to have the most drought resilience and growth spurt after the major drought in 2015

## Discussion

These findings suggest more researches on the topic of climatic stressors (precipitation and temperature) in other rainforests around the world, further providing preventative care for the forest's ecosystem.
